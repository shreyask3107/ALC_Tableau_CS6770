## Question Description: 7. ALC Tableau Implement ALC Tableau. 
For an ALC KB and a query given in Negation Normal Form generated
by assignment 6, use ALC Tableau to determine whether the query is entailed by the KB.

## Dependencies

This code has been run on Python 3.6. Apart from usual conda libraries, to install the rest of the dependencies run:

`pip3 install xmltodict`

## Usage

`python3 main.py`

## Examples

In our code we use the xml files for the Sample Input Output.

We get an output as follows:
`Model does not exists => Query is entailed by KB`
